# DAQLogger
These files are simply examples explaining how you can record events and use OSC protocol to communicate with DAQViewer. One needs to add these features to their own behavioral codes eventually to make it work. So fat we have only tested Bonsai-rx, Python 3, and Matlab, but in theory, any scripts/softwares that can interact with NI-DAQmx should work.

## Bonsai-rx
Tested using Bonsai ver.2.8.5 on Windows 10.
Install following dependencies.
- Bonsai
- Bonsai.DAQmx 
- NI-DAQmax **version 19.0** (The only version that works with Bonsai.DAQmx as of Sep 2024.)
